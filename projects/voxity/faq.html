            <h2>Can you download voxity?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes - Audion automatically "installs" itself as an offline PWA when you visit it. There is also an
                experimental Electron version for Windows that you can download <a
                    href="https://i.exerinity.com/download-audion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It does
                nothing special, it's literally just an executable wrapper around the web version, only much more bulky.
                I recommend using the web version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, here is a quick table comparing the two versions:

            <h2>Why isn't mobile supported?</h2>
            <p>
                Because I hate mobile and don't care who uses it. Also, the abundance of multiple screen sizes and iOS's
                sandboxed "Files" app is just hell - not worth dealing with. Further, if you're on a phone, it probably
                already has an app capable of playing music, and if not, use <a href="https://player.exerinity.com"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tiny media player</a> I made instead.
            </p>
            <h2>Is Audion better than this or that?</h2>
            <p>
                No. Defining "better" is subjective, and regardless of which subject you pick, it's still a no.
            </p>
            <h2>Are you here to compete with Spotify or TIDAL or VLC or foobar or some other music player?</h2>
            <p>
                Nah. The provided examples per se are made for the masses or at least a better purpose, Audion is not. But, feel free to compare.
            </p>
            <h2>Is it open source?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes/No. There is no public repository, however I don't obfuscate or minify any code, so what I write,
                you get. Simply, go to <a href="view-source:https://voxity.exerinity.com" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">view-source:https://voxity.exerinity.com</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Can I suggest a feature?</h2>
            <p>
                Maybe, <a href="https://exerinity.com/email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email me</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>What is this error?</h2>
            <p>
                Audion will usually only throw an error if the file is unsupported by your browser, or missing metadata.
                If it's something else, <a href="https://exerinity.com/email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email
                    me</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Can you jump to a specific time or playback speed or volume?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yes. Click on the label above the scrubber and a modal will open asking for the exact value.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What metadata is required?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Virtually none, but for best results, title, album, artist, and cover. Here's what does what:
            <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Title, artist, album: shown in the main UI + used for lyrics searching (LRCLIB requires them AND
                    duration)</li>
                <li>Cover: shown in the main UI and favicon</li>
            </ul>
            That's it. I was kinda expecting that list to say more, but it's not rocket science.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What formats don't work?
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have tested (in Chrome 140) <abbr title="Musepack">MPC</abbr>, <abbr
                    title="Audio Interchange File Format">AIFF</abbr> - these formats don't even play.<br>I have tested
                <abbr title="Opus... is Opus. no abbreviations.">Opus</abbr>, <abbr
                    title="Waveform Audio File Format">WAV</abbr>, <abbr
                    title="Ogg container (typically with Vorbis or Opus audio)">OGG</abbr> - these do not load
                metadata.<br><strong><abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr>, and <abbr title="MPEG-1/2 Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> or <abbr title="Advanced Audio Coding">AAC</abbr>
                    work the best (at least in my testing) for both
                    metadata and playback.</strong>
            </p>
            <h2>
                What browser works best?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Chrome. Any V8 derivative would probably work just as well, but there's less stuff in the way, at least from my testing. For example, <a href="https://i.exerinity.com/jbWM55QUHC.png">Opera's little file picker</a>, or Edge's... existence. Firefox works great too, but Chrome feels quicker with Audion.<br><br>
                In other words, OG Chrome works best because it has the best integration with PWAs and OS-level APIs, and no bloat/weird side-functions.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What can you click and what does it do?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Almost everything you see, you can click. Here is a list of what does what:
            <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>album cover: opens a larger version in a modal, and clicking the larger version opens the raw image
                    in a new tab</li>
                <li>title, artist, album: copies the respective metadata to your clipboard</li>
                <li>status bar: copies "Title by Artist" to your clipboard</li>
                <li>scrubber labels: opens a modal to enter a specific value (speed, time, volume)</li>
                <li>that circle button: restarts the track</li>
                <li>the "toys" button: opens a modal allowing you to push fake errors, status messages, and message
                    boxes</li>
                <li>the "lyrics" button: opens a modal where you can enter your own LRC lyrics</li>
                <li>the "theme" button: self explanatory</li>
                <li>a line in the lyrics modal: jumps to that line</li>
                <li>the visualizer canvas: a modal to change the mode</li>
            </ul>
            You can also scroll over sliders to, well, slide. and also, pressing numeric keys jumps to the percentage of
            the song played through (e.g. pressing 4 jumps to 40% done).
            </p>
            <h2>
                Why does it use so much memory?
            </h2>
            <p>
                For what it is and does, I don't think it uses that much. As I said above, it uses about 44 MB on
                average, playing a FLAC, with lyrics and everything going. If Audion is using more than 250 MB,
                something is wrong, and you should probably refresh the page or clear your cache and local storage for
                voxity - a hard reset.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Is Audion free to use?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yes, both monetarily and permissively. Audion doesn't cost money to use and also in the public domain.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Does Audion sound better than normally playing audio in a browser?
            </h2>
            <p>
                No. Audion isn't designed for audiophile use, it's for casual listening.
            </p>
            <h2>
                So, it doesn't work on mobile, play better, or have every feature... what <i>is</i> this for?
            </h2>
            <p>
                My own usage. I have a planet of locally stored music, and made Audion for myself... I'm just publicly sharing it.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Why did you make this?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Because the &lt;audio&gt; element is fun to work with, and I have an absurd amount of music on my computer. About 100 GB, or 9000 songs.<br><br>
                I am 100% positive there are other players like it, but I couldn't find one (nor did I really look), so...
