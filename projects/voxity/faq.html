            <h2>Where do lyrics come from?</h2>
            <p>
                Lyrics are fetched from <a href="https://lrclib.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LRCLIB</a>, a free
                lyrics
                database. If no lyrics are found there, none are shown. You can also manually enter lyrics by clicking
                the "Paste lyrics" button, or drag-and-drop a .lrc, .srt, or .vtt file to the dropzone.
            </p>
            <h2>Can I add my own stuff / break / mutate / mutilate / download it locally?</h2>
            <p>
                Sure. Download it and go wild. Voxity is yours.
            </p>
            <h2>Can I donate?</h2>
            <p>
                If you are considering donating to me, don't, <a
                    href="https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrclib?tab=readme-ov-file#donation" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">instead donate to LRCLIB</a>. I can't imagine the amount of requests they handle
                daily, <a href="https://lrclib.net/docs" target="_blank">especially considering the extremely permissive
                    API</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Can you download Voxity?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes - Voxity automatically "installs" itself as an offline PWA when you visit it. There is also an
                outdated
                experimental Electron version for Windows that you can download <a
                    href="https://vienna.exerinity.dev/download-audion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It does
                nothing special, it's literally just an executable wrapper around the web version, only much more bulky.
                I recommend using the web version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, here is a quick table comparing the two versions:

            <h2>Is Voxity better than this or that?</h2>
            <p>
                No. Defining "better" is subjective, and regardless of which subject you pick, it's still a no.
            </p>
            <h2>Are you here to compete with Spotify or TIDAL or VLC or foobar or some other music player?</h2>
            <p>
                No, comparing on-demand streaming services (Spotify, TIDAL) or full native media players (VLC, fb2k) to a web app made by
                one person is quite stupid. But, knock yourself out.
            </p>
            <h2>Is it open source?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes. Inspect element.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Can you jump to a specific time or playback speed or volume?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yes. Click on the label above the scrubber and a modal will open asking for the exact value. Also, press
                your numerical keys to jump to the respective percentage in a song, for example, pressing 2 jumps to
                20%. Holding Shift while doing this executes a half-jump, for example, pressing Shift+2 jumps to 15%.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What metadata is required?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Virtually none, but for best results, title, album, artist, and cover. Here's what does what:
            <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Title, artist, album: shown in the main UI + used for lyrics searching (LRCLIB requires them AND
                    duration)</li>
                <li>Cover: shown in the main UI and favicon</li>
            </ul>
            That's it. I was kinda expecting that list to say more, but it's not rocket science.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What browser works best?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Chrome. Any modern browser with a good JS engine will run it fine, especially Firefox, but main OG
                Chrome personally gives <i>me</i> the best experience. Chromium based browsers will probably also run it
                just as good. However, Chrome feels best because of how straightforward it is and the way it handles
                installed PWAs. For example, things like Opera's little preemptive file picker, Edge's existence, or
                Vivaldi's weird status bar and whatnot feel odd. <strong><i>Whatever, use what you want!</i></strong>
            </p>
            <h2>
                What can you click and what does it do?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Almost everything you see, you can click. Here is a list of what does what:
            <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>album cover: opens a larger version in a modal, and clicking the larger version opens the raw image
                    in a new tab</li>
                <li>title, artist, album: copies the respective metadata to your clipboard</li>
                <li>status bar text: copies "Title by Artist" to your clipboard</li>
                <li>slider labels: opens a modal to enter a specific value (speed, time, volume)</li>
                <li>the reverse button: restarts the track</li>
                <li>a line in the lyrics zone: jumps to that line</li>
                <li>the visualizer canvas: a modal to change the mode</li>
                <li>"Voxity" in the top left or right corner (conditional on playback): opens an about modal</li>
            </ul>
            You can also scroll over sliders to, well, slide. and also, pressing numeric keys jumps to the percentage of
            the song played through (e.g. pressing 4 jumps to 40% done).
            </p>
            <h2>
                How much RAM is it? Is it lighter than this or that? And if not, WHY?
            </h2>
            <p>
                I didn't fine-tune Voxity to use minimal memory. However, I also didn't fuck it sideways with
                unnecessary frameworks or whatnot. Depending on how much you have queued, its actual memory usage is
                quite low. Typically under 150 MB.<br>
                <img src="https://vienna.exerinity.dev/kK7ynKoCLf.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"><br>
                Here, you can see I have the entire "Welcome to the Future" album by Mord Fustang queued, in FLAC, and
                its only using 92 MB.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Does Voxity sound better than normally playing audio in a browser?
            </h2>
            <p>
                No - Voxity literally uses the normal &lt;audio&gt; element to play, so it's identical.
